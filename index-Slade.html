    const people = ['Beck, Glenn', 'Becker, Carl', 'Beckett, Samuel', 'Beddoes, Mick', 'Beecher, Henry', 'Beethoven, Ludwig', 'Begin, Menachem', 'Belloc, Hilaire', 'Bellow, Saul', 'Benchley, Robert', 'Benenson, Peter', 'Ben-Gurion, David', 'Benjamin, Walter', 'Benn, Tony', 'Bennington, Chester', 'Benson, Leana', 'Bent, Silas', 'Bentsen, Lloyd', 'Berger, Ric', 'Bergman, Ingmar', 'Berio, Luciano', 'Berle, Milton', 'Berlin, Irving', 'Berne, Eric', 'Bernhard, Sandra', 'Berra, Yogi', 'Berry, Halle', 'Berry, Wendell', 'Bethea, Erin', 'Bevan, Aneurin', 'Bevel, Ken', 'Biden, Joseph', 'Bierce, Ambrose', 'Biko, Steve', 'Billings, Josh', 'Biondo, Frank', 'Birrell, Augustine', 'Black, Elk', 'Blair, Robert', 'Blair, Tony', 'Blake, William'];

    // Array.prototype.filter()
    // 1. Filter the list of inventors for those who were born in the 1500's
    let born1500s = inventors.filter(x => x.year >= 1500 && x.year < 1600);
    console.log('born1500s',born1500s);

    //long way of doing it (but to help you understand what filter function is actually doing)
    const fifteen = inventors.filter(function(inventor) {
      if(inventor.year >= 1500 && inventor.year < 1600) {
        return true; //keep it!
        //****The filter using the arrow function doesn't have to 'return true' because the arrow function is already returning when it is ture
      }
    })
    console.table(fifteen);

    // 2. Give us an array of the inventors' first and last names
    let firstAndLastName = inventors.map(x => `${x.first} ${x.last}`);
    console.log('firstAndLastName',firstAndLastName);
    
    // Array.prototype.sort()
    // 3. Sort the inventors by birthdate, oldest to youngest
    //*****The way that sort works is that you get two items, and you're asked to sort just those two items, like is person a or b younger. you then assign person a and b values of either a 1 or -1, and it's going to bubble those items up and down in the array. Looks like -1 makes it go earlier in array (to the left) and 1 makes it go later (to the right)****
    let ordered = inventors.sort(function(firstPerson, secondPerson) {
      if(firstPerson.year > secondPerson.year) {
        return 1;
      } else {
        return -1;
      }
    });

    console.table(ordered);

    // using ternary which is a lot easier
    const orderedAnotherVersion = inventors.sort((a,b) => a.year > b.year ? 1 : -1);

    console.table(orderedAnotherVersion);

    // Array.prototype.reduce()
    // 4. How many years did all the inventors live?

    // ****** What a reduce will do, where like a sort or a map or filter will take items in and they will sort them or turn into something else or filter them down, what a reduce will do will allow you to build something on every single one. For example, if you've ever done something like below:

    var totalYears1 = 0;

    for (var i = 0; i < inventors.length; i++) {
      totalYears1 += inventors[i].passed - inventors[i].year;
    }

    console.log(totalYears1);

    // --> reduce is much cleaner way to do that and don't need the [i] ****

    const totalYears = inventors.reduce((total, inventor) => {
      return total + (inventor.passed - inventor.year);
    }, 0); 
    // The reduce is working by giving you a running total and also give you the inventor, and from that we will return the total and the number of years that inventor had lived.
    // Also, had to add 0 at end because totalYears needs to know where to start like in long loop version above
    console.log('totalYears',totalYears);

    // 5. Sort the inventors by years lived
    const oldest = inventors.sort((a,b) => (a.passed - a.year) > (b.passed - b.year) ? -1 : 1);
    console.log('oldest',oldest);
    console.table(oldest);

    // 6. create a list of Boulevards in Paris that contain 'de' anywhere in the name
    // https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Boulevards_in_Paris
    // you do this by entering the code below in the console of the webpage above
    
    // const category = document.querySelector('.mw-category');
    // const links = Array.from(category.querySelectorAll('a'));
    // //***Had to use Array.from because the array the queryselector gets back is a NodeList which is really an array like object and Array.from turns it into an array that 'map' method can then use (without it you'll get a warning in console that links.map is not a function (because map can only be used on arrays!!)). Can also use a spread operator like so, const links = [...category.querySelectorAll('a')]; This will take every item out of something, an iterable, and spread it into an array**

    // const de = links
    //               .map(link => link.textContent)
    //               .filter(streetname => streetname.includes('de'));



    // 7. sort Exercise
    // Sort the people alphabetically by last name
    // ~18 minutes in video to get better explanation as to what he's doing
    const alpha = people.sort(function(lastOne, nextOne) {
      // const parts = lastOne.split(', ');
      // console.log('parts',parts);
      const [aLast, aFirst] = lastOne.split(', '); // ****this seems to take it out of an array and make it a string by declaring the variable in brackets - look into this*****
      console.log('aLast, aFirst',aLast, aFirst);
      const [bLast, bFirst] = nextOne.split(', ');
      return aLast > bLast ? 1 : -1;
      //****If wanted to return an object or array instead, that's where 'reduce' methode comes in handy
    })

    // 8. Reduce Exercise
    // Sum up the instances of each of these
    const data = ['car', 'car', 'truck', 'truck', 'bike', 'walk', 'car', 'van', 'bike', 'walk', 'car', 'van', 'car', 'truck' ];
    
    const instances = data.reduce((obj, item) => {
      if (!obj[item]) {
        obj[item] = 0;
      } //have to do above to check what the increment number is, and if it doesn't exist, it starts it at 0
      obj[item]++;
      return obj;
    }, {});

    console.log('instances',instances);

    //we start with a blank object (the empty {} at end, like in previous example we had '0' - it's like a starting point), and we see how many instances there are
